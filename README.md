# Patient-Thyroisism-Analysis
### Overview
Nairobi Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. The data collected focused on Thyroid patients. Use the healthcare datasets provided to accomplish the following:  

Build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.

### Problem Statement

>Build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid using the following machine learning algoriths:
>
> ### 1. Decision Trees
We will use the following trees to classify a whether a patient has hypothyroididm or tests negatively:
> 
>- Random Forest Classifier
- AdaBoost Classifier
- Gradient Boost Classifier
>
> The Adaboost and Gradient boost trees are optimization techniques for the random forest trees.
>
> ### 2. SVM Models
> 
> We will use the following SVM models to to place a patient in the right category with regards to predicting their hypothyroidism status:
>- Polynomial
- Linear
- RBF
